# About Repo
This repo is the part of Web Dev Cohort 2026. This is a clone of desktop-first developer tool landing page inspired by the Cursor website. The goal of this assignment is visual and structural accuracy, not creativity or interactivity.
### what you accept from this repo:
Using only HTML & CSS. No Javascript, neither any Labriary and framework has been used in this project. Animations or effects have also avoided. For the time being, this project has only desktop view (no resposiveness).
I've tried as much as possible to use images & icons, match the fonts, colors and layout similar to the website.
## Live Demo
